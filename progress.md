# Sector Defense - Progress

Original prompt: build an iphone game that is a knockoff of starcraft2 tower defenses

## Phase 4: Interactive Tutorial + Accessibility — COMPLETE

### Changes Applied
- **Tutorial system**: 13-step guided intro across 3 waves
- **Tutorial state machine**: TUTORIAL object with start/advance/finish, waitingFor states (tap_cell, select_tower, start_wave, wait_wave_end, tap_tower, acknowledge)
- **Tutorial overlays**: Dim screen with cell cutouts, pulsing highlight borders, animated arrows, step indicator dots, message boxes with glow
- **Tutorial menu button**: Conditionally shown when tutorialDone===false, green glow, inserted via menuItems.unshift()
- **Tutorial tap interception**: Handles forced tower selection, cell restrictions, wave preview auto-start, waveSummary auto-skip
- **Reduce Motion**: Settings toggle, wraps VFX update/draw calls, skips screen shake, skips splash animation, skips env particles
- **Color Blind mode**: Settings toggle cycling off→deuteranopia→protanopia, getColorBlindColor() remapping, drawColorBlindMarker() symbol overlays
- **Settings screen**: 2 new rows (Reduce Motion ♿, Color Blind 👁) with tap handlers
- **prog.tutorialDone**: Persisted to localStorage, marks tutorial completion

### Bugs Found & Fixed During QA
- Tutorial blocked wavePreview tap during wait_wave_end → added passthrough for wavePreview phase
- Tutorial waveSummary never transitioned to build → moved auto-advance check to update() function before early-return
- Screen shake stuck after wave during tutorial → reset shakeTimer on waveSummary→build transition
- Tutorial said "40 waves" but game has 30 → changed to "all waves"

### Known Issues / TODOs for Next Phase
- Tutorial places extra towers due to rapid tap sequencing (cosmetic, doesn't break flow)
- Could add tutorial skip button for returning players
- Color blind markers could be more visible during fast gameplay
- Consider adding haptic feedback patterns for accessibility

## Phase 3: Visual Polish & Animation — COMPLETE

### Changes Applied
- **VFX system**: Object with trails, death rings, env particles, hit flash, tower angles, wave flash, low health pulse, vignette, splash screen state
- **Splash screen**: 2.5s animated intro (elastic title, scanning line, typing subtitle)
- **Enhanced towers**: Hexagonal base platforms, level rings, rotation toward enemies, unique per-type geometric detail for all 10 towers
- **Enhanced enemies**: Motion trails, hit flash (white burst), boss aura, inner detail patterns per shape, wing flap animations, orbiting dots, cargo pods, drill rotation
- **Projectile variety**: Sentinel=dot+trail, Thunder=large orb, Hawk=missile triangle, Neural=spiral dots, Nova=rotating star, Shockwave=ring pulse
- **Multi-shape particles**: rect, circle, line, triangle with rotation
- **Map terrain**: Dot grid intersections, biome-specific ground detail (urban=circuit traces, volcanic=lava cracks, arctic=frost crystals), enhanced entry chevrons, exit shield icon
- **Environmental particles**: Per-biome floating particles (volcanic embers, arctic snowflakes, urban data dots)
- **Screen effects**: Subtle scanline overlay, vignette during gameplay, wave start blue flash, red border when lives < 5
- **Enhanced death**: Death ring bursts + white fragment particles on enemy kill
- **Enhanced placement**: Double ring + hex flash animation

### QA Results
- Splash screen renders correctly with animated title
- Menu displays with color-coded glowing buttons, NEW badges
- All 10 tower types render with distinct geometric shapes on hexagonal platforms
- Biome-specific terrain verified: Urban (circuit traces), Volcanic (lava pools/embers), Arctic (frost crystals/snowflakes)
- Combat effects working: damage numbers, death rings, projectiles, hit flash
- Wave summary overlay renders cleanly
- Map selection with biome tabs functional
- Performance: 60 FPS steady

## Previous Phases
- **Phase 1**: Persistence + Core UX (localStorage, safe areas, auto-pause, button feedback)
- **Phase 2**: Audio Overhaul (procedural music, multi-oscillator SFX, 10 tower profiles)

## TODO / Next Steps
- Phase 4: Social features, achievements display, leaderboards
- Phase 5: Additional content (new towers, enemies, maps)
- App Store packaging (PWA → native wrapper)
